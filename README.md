# Moody Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

In this project I want to try and see whether any level of animation is possible in Python and test my basic coding skills.
