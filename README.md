# Sassy Hangman


![preview](images/gui.jpg)

In one of my first Python projects, I wanted to test my understanding of the language basics by building a Hangman game.

To add a bit of flair, I've added randomized, campy lines for the... executioner, if you will.

### Profanity Warning ðŸ¤¬

The wordlist **does** include swearwords, therefore it's not impossible for the game answer to be obscene - thought it would be worth noting.

### Requirements
You will find this on the light side, with the only thing needed to run the game being the 'requests' library to pull the list of 10,000 words from an MIT page.

Run: `pip install requests` to install.

If this doesn't work, try replacing `pip` with `pip3`.
