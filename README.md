# Sassy Hangman


![preview](images/gui.jpg)

In one of my first Python projects, I wanted to test my understanding of the language basics by building a Hangman game.

To add a bit of flair, I've added randomized lines for the... executioner, if you will. 

### Requirements
You will find this on the light side, with the only thing needed to run the game being the 'requests' library.

Run: `pip install requests` to install.

If this doesn't work, try replacing `pip` with `pip3`.
